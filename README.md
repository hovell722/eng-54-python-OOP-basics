# OOP Basics

This repo will contain our OOP basics.

We will look at:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


## Class
Is like a cookie cutter, that creates instances of cookies.

They wrappers to define how an object looks and behaves.

Classes will wrap characteristics as attributes, and behaviours and methods.

## Methods Vs. Functions
Methods are functions that belong to a specific data type.

Where functions are anonymous and anything can call and run them.

Where as **methods NEED the instance to be called.**

## Characteristics / how an object looks like
These are attributes that are assigned to each instance.
They are variables assigned to an object / instance.

## Instance
Occurrence of something.

## Self
Refers to the instance of on which a method is being called.

self.name = 'ringo'

this means that specific object attributes name will have the string 'ringo'

## Abstraction
The **ability to hide complexity.**

We do this by using:
- separation of concerns
- documentation
    - specify which methods and how to use them
- inheritance --> causes some abstraction

Real life examples are everywhere:
- changing
- heating up food with one button
- using our cards to pass security

## Inheritance
Is the ability to pass to child class all the methods and characteristics.
This is one of the big reasons of OOP - it means you can re-use code!

**promise of reusable code**


## Encapsulation


## Polymorphism
